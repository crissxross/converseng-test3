<!-- Should npcTurn be a custom event emitter? i.e. an output, passing an $event? See examples in harmonics-explorer - e.g. partial.component or main-menu.component -->

<!-- For example:
  (someCustomEvent)="npcTurn.emit(actor)"
I don't know if that is correct - need to find out more !!!! -->

<div class="npc-speaks">
  <p>{{ npcSpeaks | async }} npc speaks for testing! This is a 'p' in a 'div'.</p>
